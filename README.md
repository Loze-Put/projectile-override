# Projectile Override [![installs](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://api.runelite.net/pluginhub/shields/installs/plugin/projectile-override)](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/Loze-Put)

This plugin replaces boss projectiles with alternatives that are easier to distinguish in color, shape, or contrast. It aims to improve accessibility for colorblind and visually impaired players by reducing ambiguity in high-pressure PvM encounters. All changes are visual-only and do not affect game balance.

## Bosses

Boss projectiles can be replaced by any other bosses' projectiles. Note that not all bosses support melee projectiles. If a boss with melee projectiles is overridden by a boss without melee projectiles, the melee projectiles will still show as their original. The following bosses are currently supported:
